# Just_Black
A revival of JustBlack theme by Dddsasul: "A nice and black theme."  Use Discord's dark theme for best experience.  The theme removes all borders for a borderless design with gradients.  One can change the highlights in a code editor, such as Notepad.

This theme also has a 'Just_White' variant when using Discord's light theme.
